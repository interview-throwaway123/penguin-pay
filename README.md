# Penguin Pay üêß

## Time Savers

- Storing exchange rate APP_ID in code & hitting the API from the frontend
- Using native IEEE 754 floating point for currency conversion arithmetic and `.toFixed(2)` instead of a fixed point library like Decimal.js
- Not solving `TextInput` behavior where invalid character entries flash before being erased
- Storing strings in `copy` object, no `i18n` translations
- No input mask on Phone Number
- The 'onBlur' prop of CurrencyConversionInput has weird usability if value is 0.00
